Fire and Ice 
<br>Some say the world will end in fire, 
<br>Some say in ice.
<br>From what I have tasted of desire
<br>I hold with those who favor fire.
<br>But if it had to perish twice,
<br>I think I know enough of hate
<br>To say that for destruction ice
<br>Is also great
<br>And would
<br>suffice
