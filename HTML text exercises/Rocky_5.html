	John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress begins our 100-part list of the best novels written in English. Robert McCrum explains its enduring appeal
	</p>
	<p>
		The English novel begins behind bars, in extremis. Its first author, <strong>John Bunyan</strong>, was a <strong>JPuritan</strong> dissenter whose writing starts with sermons and ends with fiction. His famous allegory, the story of <strong>Christian</strong>, opens with a sentence of luminous simplicity that has the haunting compulsion of the hook in a great melody. "As I walk'd through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place, where was a Denn; And I laid me down in that place to sleep: And as I slept I dreamed a Dream."
